Investment Recommender System  
📌 Project Overview  
The Investment Recommender System is a machine learning–driven application designed to help investors identify the most promising sectors and locations for investment opportunities.   
It leverages state-level economic, demographic, and business data to provide personalized recommendations based on factors such as Return on Investment (ROI), risk levels, sector performance,   
and local government penetration.  

This project is particularly tailored for Nasarawa State Investment and Development Agency (NASIDA) and other government/investment promotion agencies, enabling data-driven decision-making and   
smart investment promotion.  

🚀 Features  
📊 Data Analysis Dashboard: Explore investment trends across sectors and LGAs.  
🤖 Machine Learning Model: Recommends investment opportunities based on investor profile.  
🌍 Geospatial Insights: Maps investments to specific LGAs for location-based decisions.  
🖥️ API Service (FastAPI): Provides endpoints for integrating recommendations into external platforms.  
📈 Investor Profiles: Tailored recommendations by risk appetite, sector preference, and capital.  
🛠️ Tech Stack  
Languages: Python (3.9+)  
Frameworks: FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Folium  
Data: State-level sector investment datasets (synthetic + real data integration)  
Deployment: Streamlit (for UI), Docker (optional), Hugging Face Spaces

🧠 How It Works  
Load sector & LGA investment data.  
Preprocess investor input (capital, risk profile, preferred sector).  
Apply machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).  
Generate ranked recommendations of investment opportunities.  
Visualize recommendations via dashboard and API.  
📊 Example Use Case  
Investor A: ₦10M capital, low risk appetite, prefers Agriculture.  
System Output:  
Agriculture in Lafia (ROI: 18%, Risk: Low)  
Agro-processing in Keffi (ROI: 15%, Risk: Medium)  
Livestock in Akwanga (ROI: 14%, Risk: Low)  
📌 Future Improvements  
✅ Integration with real-time economic indicators.  
✅ Multi-sector recommendation scoring.  
✅ Advanced NLP for investor profiling.  
✅ Deploy full system on Hugging Face Spaces / AWS.
